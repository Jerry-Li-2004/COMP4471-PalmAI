\section{Conclusion}
\label{sec:conclusion}

Palmreader.ai establishes a multi-modal pipeline that performs fortune-telling through palm reading, incorporating Vision Transformers (ViT), a Neural Network for scoring, as well as a Large Language Model (LLM) for final inference.
We have provided a first step in using a data-driven approach to draw superstitious practices towards science.
We expect to produce a robust model that can effectively generate accurate palm-reading results.

Further work may optimize the pipeline by employing more powerful pretrained text decoders. 
Additionally, external data related to palmistry may be used for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with the LLM in the final inference step,
to provide context whenever required as additional support.
