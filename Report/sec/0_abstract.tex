Palm-reading is the practice of fortune-telling by reading one’s palm.
While it dates back to centuries ago, it is regarded as a pseudoscience by many due to a lack of scientific evidence, and is generally performed subjectively by humans.
However, with modern statistical and deep learning techniques, we propose an automatic palm reading system by learning characteristics and hidden features within datasets. 
We construct a pipeline with vision transformers, object detection, and large language models to produce palm reading results and predictions from simply an image of the user’s palm. 
Our project also uncovers the statistical connection between palm features and personal life experiences, creating a path for further related work.
